# Meter

Using the `low` and `high` props it is possible to set the key points of the `Meter`

## Low Point

The **low** value that the meter uses to determine what a low value is can be set using the `low` prop.

In this example the `low` is set to `30`, the `min` is set to 0, `max` is defaulting to 100, and `value` is set to 25.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Min Value" args={{ value: 25, low: 30 }}>
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## High Point

The **high** value that the meter uses to determine what a high value is can be set using the `high` prop.

In this example the `high` is set to `30`, the `min` is defaulting to 0, `max` is set to 50, and `value` is set to 35.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Max Value" args={{ max: 50, value: 35, high: 30 }}>
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## High & Low Point

The **high** and **low** values can be set at the same time.

In this example the `low` is set to `10`, the `high` is set to `70`, the value value is `45`.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Max/Min Values" args={{ low: 10, high: 70, value: 45 }}>
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
