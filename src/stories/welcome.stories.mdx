## The purpose:

The purpose of this package is to "Reactify" the Web Experience Toolkit (WET). This will make it faster and easier to develope applications using WET. It also removes the JQuery dependency of WET.

This project has 3 main goals:

- make it easier to create frontend apps
- have accessible components (WCAG AA)
- clean and accurate documentation (Storybook)

## How to run locally:

1. clone the repo to you local machine
2. open terminal inside the project directory
3. install packages using `npm install`
4. launch Storybook using `npm run storybook`
5. navigate to `http://localhost:6006` to see Storybook running based on you local code. As you save your changes, the storybook will automatically update.

## Project scripts:

Here is what each script in the `package.json` does:

- `test`: runs the component tests
- `lint`: runs ESlint to check for issues
- `lint:fix`: runs ESlint to check for issues and auto fixes them
- `prettier`: runs prettier to check for code styling issues
- `prettier:fix`: runs prettier to check for code styling issues and auto fixes them
- `storybook`: spins up a dev instance of Storybook that is based on the local changes. The running application can be found at `http://localhost:6006`
- `build-storybook`: builds a static version of Storybook (not often needed)
- `chromatic`: Deploy the current code to a chromatic image and provide a sharable link
- `prepare`: Enable Git hooks
